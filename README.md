# AUCell
AUCell is an R-package to analyze the state of gene-sets in single-cell RNA-seq data (i.e. identify cells with active gene signatures).

We recommend to **install** AUCell from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/AUCell.html). This Github repository is meant mostly for development.

A **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/AUCell/inst/doc/AUCell.html) is included in the package.


To use with **SCENIC** we recommend the following versions:
- SCENIC 0.1.5 requires [AUCell 0.99.5](http://scenic.aertslab.org/downloads/Rpackages/AUCell_0.99.5.tar.gz)
